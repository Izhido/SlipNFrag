While Slip & Frag is currently in a fully playable state, and even allows for some experimentation with modifications such as new maps created by the Quake user community, users might anyway have some questions about the usage of the game engine, and some could even have stumbled upon game failures or crashes that they wish to report.

Be sure to check the [Readme](README.md) and the [Build Instructions](BUILD.md) first, if you need answers for some of your questions. I will try to have them updated as frequently as possible.

An issue tracker for Slip & Frag has been enabled, and it is available [here](https://github.com/Izhido/SlipNFrag/issues).

Source code for the engine is officially available [here](https://github.com/Izhido/SlipNFrag.git) as well - the original Quake engine is, after all, available under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 2.0.
